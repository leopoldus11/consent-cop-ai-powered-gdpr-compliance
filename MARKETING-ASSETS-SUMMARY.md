# Consent Cop Marketing Assets

## 📝 Recommended Marketing Copy

**Primary Recommendation:**
```
Stop compliance violations before they cost you millions. Real-time GDPR & CCPA audit tool that catches unauthorized tracking the moment it happens.
```

### Why This Works:
- ✅ Leads with biggest pain point (costly fines - millions)
- ✅ Emphasizes real-time detection (competitive advantage)
- ✅ Specific about what it does (catches unauthorized tracking)
- ✅ Appeals to both executives (cost) and technical teams (real-time)
- ✅ Creates urgency ("before they cost you")
