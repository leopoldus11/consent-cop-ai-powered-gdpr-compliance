# Consent Cop Marketing Copy

## Recommended Copy (Option 1 - Benefit-Focused)

## Alternative Options

### Option 2 - Problem-Solution
**"Never face another privacy fine. Automatically detect and report tracking violations before consent—protect your business with AI-powered compliance audits."**

### Option 5 - Professional & Comprehensive
**"Automated privacy compliance validation. Detects unauthorized tracking, prevents consent leaks, and protects against GDPR & CCPA fines—all in real-time."**

## Why These Work Better

### Original Text Issues:
- "Utility" is vague and technical
- "Firing triggers" is developer jargon
- Doesn't emphasize the business impact (fines, legal risk)
- Doesn't highlight the AI/automation advantage

### New Copy Benefits:
✅ **Emotional hook**: "Stop violations before they cost you millions"
✅ **Clear value**: Prevent fines, protect business
✅ **Audience appeal**: Speaks to both technical and business stakeholders
✅ **Unique selling point**: AI-powered, automated, real-time
✅ **Urgency**: "before they catch you"
✅ **Trust**: Positions as a protective tool, not just a utility

## Recommendation
**Use Option 1** - It's the most compelling because it:
1. Leads with the biggest pain point (costly fines)
2. Is specific about what it does (catches unauthorized tracking)
3. Emphasizes timing (real-time, the moment it happens)
4. Appeals to both C-suite (cost) and technical teams (real-time detection)
